/**
 * Ambient window background.
 *
 * Adapted from docs/tauribg.txt: two blurred colour blobs bleeding down from the top edge,
 * over a radial vignette that darkens toward the bottom. The reference uses an indigo
 * `primary` plus `red-400`; here both blobs sit in the app's own accent family so the
 * backdrop reinforces the identity instead of introducing a second hue.
 *
 * Kept deliberately low-contrast: this sits behind real UI, so it must never compete with
 * text or controls. Callers gate it on Paper-PC mode (see Layout.tsx), which is also why
 * this is plain CSS — no WebGL, no animation, nothing to disable.
